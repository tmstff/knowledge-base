### Presentation / Teaching Learnings
 
- Plan recaps
	- done by the participants!
	- e.g. Practice Overview
- Icebreakers & "looseners" are super important
	- [Ice Breakers](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/ice-breakers/)
	- some examples:
		- agile faces
		- Sort by Birthday
		- motivating / funny / interesting videos
		- individual / pair / mob drawing (Steven Tyler)
 - Keep an eye on the mood!
	 - e.g. with feedback techniques from above, but also be mindful
 - Optimize communication for audience
	- Involve audience with questions (right amount!)
	- What questions will the audience most likely want to have answered?
	- Right level of explanation detail & special terms
