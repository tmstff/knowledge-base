    * "Psychological safety was far and away the most important of the five dynamics we found"
        * ask for help without judgement on competence
        * ask for goal without sounding like the only one out of loop

        * Mindfulness
            * Paying attention is about noticing how you feeld, how people around you are feeling and approaching people and the organisation with curiosity and not judgement.

            * -> go with the idea, improvise, leave room for creativity
        * Are you OK? -> replace judgent with curiosity
