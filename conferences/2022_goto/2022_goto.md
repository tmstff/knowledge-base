## Sabotaging a Transformation

Fred George

### abstract

Transformation efforts must overcome a myriad of challenges to achieve success. Some of the inhibitors we will discuss include:

    ● Executives unaware of the transformation
    ● Failure to engage all the necessary parties
    ● Individuals losing power with the transformation
    ● New roles and disappearing roles
    ● Lack of an effective Change Agent
    ● Success conservatism
    ● Lazy buyers
    ● Blame-oriented cultures

For each of these inhibitors, we will cite a) situations where this occurred, b) mitigation actions to overcome the inhibitor, and c) the effectiveness of these efforts.

We will conclude by suggesting some best practices we are currently employing in anticipation of likely inhibitors, including our newest proposal process of only selling complete solutions to our clients (not just body-shopping people).

Thought that your software applications do not have any impact on the environment? Guess again! Your applications run on servers that consume electricity, commonly generated by burning coal/oil/gas, all of them producing carbon dioxide (CO2), the main driver of climate change.

This session provides practical guidelines on how to reduce the environmental footprint of your applications. It is assumed you are involved in building software applications and aspire to help prevent climate change.

### notes

* Top C02 producer: Electricity & Heat Producers (42%)
* Data centers & networks: 2% of global electricity
* what to do?
    * minimize distance (hops) data
        * close to custpomers
    * reduce size of data
        * filter out unnecessary data
        * compress data for transfer
    * host your application in a region that consumes clean energy
        * cloud.google.com/sustainability/region-carbon
    * consume less electricity
        * containers instead of VMs / servers
        * FAAS for apps with high idle-time
    * different lanuages have different energy consumption
        * compiled better than interpreted
        * python: 80 times energy consumption then c
        * consider rewrite
        * use latest java version (CPU usage 10% less, memory usage 15% less)
    * money <=> emissions
    * Azure well architected
    * include sustainability in architecture requirements / NFAs

### ideas & questions

* check how idle times are handled in AWS / GCP / Azure
    * => does this really save resources?
* energy consumption c vs go
* include sustainability in architecture requirements


## The Zen of Programming

Sander Hoogendoorn

### abtract

A personal journey towards writing beautiful code

Ever since he wrote his first lines of code in 1982, Sander Hoogendoorn has been fascinated by the beauty of some code and the pure evil of other code. In these 40 years, Sander has worked together with hundreds of developers, and he has written code in many different paradigms, languages, ecosystems, and frameworks, always in search of better and more elegant ways of solving problems.

Is there really no silver bullet? Should you follow principles or intuition? Does architecture help or block you? Can frameworks kill your projects? How solid is SOLID? Why DRY? When is your code conceived? What is beautiful and what is ugly code? Is beauty really in the eye of the beholder? Functions before objects? What are monads and should you apply them? Is small beautiful? Does unit testing make debugging obsolete? And why should you take your mother out more often?

During this inspiring new talk Sander Hoogendoorn, life-long developer and currently CTO at e-commerce company iBOOD, investigates his personal journey through platforms, languages, principles, doubts, and struggles that so many developers also encounter during their careers, illustrating ideas and patterns that influenced and inspired him to how he currently codes. Fully functional, monadic, single-lined, clean, short-named variables, and automatically tested code – of course with real-life code examples.

Get inspired to discover your Zen and find your own path towards writing beautiful code.

## Death of The Spotify Model : On Radical Productivity Improvements at Enterprise Scale

Gijs Meijer
Marcin Pakulnicki

### abstract

Many ‘productivity’ talks are filled with abstractions on how to create ‘high performing teams’. Many of them use ‘Agile’ concepts which sound nice for the internet and often work for a particular use case, but how do you actually scale improvements across a large IT enterprise? All this while maintaining engineering happiness, and delivering on your projects?

In 2015, the busdevops way of working aka ‘The Spotify model’ helped ING Bank to a next level of Agile way of work. It brought us many nice things, but we identified some issues along the way and we will cover them in the presentation. After 5 years, it was time to take the next steps.

This talk describes the good, the bad and the ugly when you want to establish a (large scale) top engineering culture and highly performant IT departments where technology is a first-class citizen. We outline how we reorganized our tribes towards product thinking, where both ‘business’ and ‘IT’ moved away from ‘Agile team purpose’. We describe in detail how we radically changed our team topologies; moved towards small, ‘purposeless’ microteams and platform teams. Next to this, we dive deeper into the crucial role which containers and OpenShift played in this transformation along with removing other ‘cognitive load’ from our engineers.
We also look what Netflix thought us about ‘talent density’ in our teams, and what it means to the profile of our software engineers.

Finally, and most importantly we share our experience on how to scale this journey for 400+ engineers, far beyond a team or a single department.

This practical talk will be stripped from empty abstractions. It is for anyone who is not afraid to improve their IT organization at scale and wants to hear a true story from ‘the trenches’ of change.

## #FAIL

Kevlin Henney

### abstract

In 2011 Kevlin Henney gave a keynote, "Cool & Useless", at the first ever GOTO Amsterdam conference. Kevlin was all about code and other geekery that was cool and well... useless.

On this tenth anniversary, he is here for another keynote. We might consider this talk to be the natural successor, uncool & supposed to be useful... or uncool & useless... or, more simply, #FAIL.

In Kevlin's opinion, software doesn't always work out. Looking at the number of software failure screens in public places, it can sometimes seem that software developers are the greatest producers of installation art around the planet. Software failures can be entertaining or disastrous. They can also be instructive — there's a lot we can learn.

In this talk, you'll learn:

    - What Kevlin has learned since he was at GOTO Amsterdam 10 years ago
    - What is there still to learn about software
    - How you can learn from failure

### notes

* initialization with 0 is easy
* time
    * start of time 1.1.1970
    * time_t -1: no time available
* "simple testing can prevent most critical failures"
    * Ding Yuan et al
    * => a majority of the production failures (77%) can be reproduced with unit tests
* how to write correct programs?
    * program verifycation / formal proof
    * "keeping the code simple is usually leads to correctness" Dijkstra
* bugs often in "easy" parts
* "Muphrys law"
* different systems (working correct on their own) may still produce interesting / unexpected results
* "Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger context"
    * intrinsic vs extrensic correctness
* "The connections between different modules are the assumptions they make"
* early detection of configuration errors reduce failure damage
* reality is often "dirty"
* Excel sheet in ecxel is bad (missing type system, error prone)
* #foreshadowing
* History is a vast forecast system
* history seems to repeat itself
* perhaps it is possible to learn from failures?

## Shut up and eat your veg!

Eamonn Boyle
Garth Gilmour

### abstract

At previous GOTO events Eamonn and Garth presented 10 lessons from the 1990s that modern developers tend to neglect.

Some attendees were in full agreement, whilst others thought they were simply wrong. For this occasion, the duo revamped the talk with fresh advice, admonitions and war stories. So come to see how there is ‘nothing new but the very old’ and acquire valuable skills that have been marginalized during the agile revolution.

In this talk, you'll learn:

    Tons of useful software development skills and practices that have atrophied in the past few decades
    Advice, resources and templates for how to reinvigorate these skills in your projects

## The Psychology of UX

Fabio Pereira

### abstract

35 thousand! That's the average number of decisions a person makes every day.

Imagine if you could hack the brain and the mind, this complex decision making systems, leveraging ways to influence yours and anyone's decisions. Gartner defines "Neurobusiness" as the capability of applying neuroscience insights to improve outcomes in customer and other business decision situations.Have you ever wondered how many digital decisions people make? The ones we make using technology devices like smartphones, wearables, laptops. The vast majority of our decisions are influenced by cognitive biases, irrational and emotional factors. For decades, scientists have been studying so we can better understand how it is possible not only to predict but also influence decisions through interventions on the environment where decisions are made. Yes, it is possible! And we will teach you the secrets behind decision making.

In this talk, you'll learn:

    How our decisions are influenced by cognitive biases, irrational and emotional factors
    How to influence decisions through interventions on the environment
    How it may affect you as an individual or organization
